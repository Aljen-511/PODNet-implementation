# PODNet-implementation
A project to implement a simple PODNet model via source paper `PODNet:Pooled Outputs Distillation for Small-Tasks Incremental Learning`.

**the arxiv link of the source paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13513**

> Just as the above description, this project will implement the PODNet model from a simple code frame. 
> This is a cooperation project by two members.
> The implementation will be based on `pytorch`. 
> This is the begin of this project, wrote on 4.27,2024.


**Note:** All the development work will upload to the branch `Dev`
